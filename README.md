# Police-Killings

## Overview
According to the Guardian, the US police kill more in days than any other country in years. In 2019, 1,004 people were shot and killed by police according to The Washington Post, whereas the "Mapping Police Violence" project counted 1,098 killed [1]. Police killings are violent in nature which disrupt the normal functioning of the society and have considerable effects on mental health, neighbourhood peace, life and politics. The death of George Floyd, Sam Dubose among others have led to violent protests in the past that have attracted substantial attention to the racialized character of police violence against the civilians. [2]

Police killings have been associated with Ethnicity solely in the past. Our motivation for the project is to create a interactive visualization dashboard that will enable law enforcement officials to delve deeper into this subject and explore the different factors like Age, Gender, Signs of Mental Illness, Location apart from Ethnicity that lead to the killings and how these different factors relate to each other.

## Introduction
According to statistics, 1 in every 1000 black men can expect to be killed by the police. On an average, the probability of being killed by police is about 1 in 2,000 for men and 1 in 33,000 in women. The age group between 20-35 years are at the highest risk. For young men of color, police use of force is among the leading causes of death. [2]

It is not mandatory for the police departments to report when an officer kills a civilian. Therefore the data collected by the FBI is not reliable [3]. Newspapers like Washington Post and the Guardian keep an active record of the police killings taking place everyday across every province in the United States along with Personal Identifiable Information (PII) for every victim. We have used these publicly available datasets for our visualization. Our dashboard will enable reconfirming the statistics, bias and hypothesis related to police killings described above and create an interactive data story about the fatal police shootings that will help the law enforcement officials investigate how the different factors connect to each other and help in formulating relevant and more effective laws to handle the situations better and improve the overall operations. 

We have used different visualization charts like line charts, choropleth maps, bar charts and parallel coordinate plots to visualize the effect of the several factors like Age, Gender, Threat Level on the police killings and how factors like Mental Illness correlate with factors like possession of weapons or threat level. We have kept in mind the principles of effective data visualization during the design of the graphs and selection of the colors to identify key insights easily.
